[![Datalayer](http://datalayer.io/img/logo-datalayer-horizontal.png)](http://datalayer.io)

Docker files for the `Datalayer platform` on `Kubernetes`.

Prebuilt distribution of the Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/datalayer).

**DISCLAIMER**: We don't ship for now the local distribution and binaries. You will have to build or download them by yourself to create your own custom images. If you feel we should provide a better way (e.g. download from the Internet), please open an issue on the [Datalayer repository](https://github.com/datalayer/datalayer/issues))
